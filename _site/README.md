I'm a big fan of big data, targeting at applying latest efficient technologies to develop useful data products.

I'm currently working in Amazon Finance Tech team as a Business Intelligence Engineer. This website is a catalog of some sandbox projects for my interests in spare time.

Before I came to US for my computational statistics master degree, I've worked for over 3 years in business analytics in gaming industry. And I like using analytics in real business world to make wiser and resonable decisions.

I'm also interested in data pipeline and warehouse technologies in TB to PB level. If you are also sharing the same enthusiasm, we should have a talk!
